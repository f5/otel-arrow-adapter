# otel-arrow-adapter

Adapter used to convert OTEL batches to/from OTEL Arrow batches in both directions.

See [OTEP 0156](https://github.com/lquerel/oteps/blob/main/text/0156-columnar-encoding.md) for more details on the OTEL Arrow protocol.

## Synthetic OTLP entities generator

### Metrics

This tool generates synthetic metrics and store them as protobuf binary files.

### Logs

This tool generates synthetic metrics and store them as protobuf binary files.

### Traces

This tool generates synthetic metrics and store them as protobuf binary files.


## Benchmarking tools

These command line tools are used to compare the performance of OTLP and OTLP Arrow entity representations. Each tool
takes as input a set of OTLP entities encoded as protobuf binary files and produces an evaluation report and a set of 
data files (CSV format).

### Metrics [WIP]

This tool compares the performance of OTLP and OTLP Arrow representations for metrics.

### Logs [WIP]

This tool compares the performance of OTLP and OTLP Arrow representations for metrics.

### Traces

This tool compares the performance of OTLP and OTLP Arrow representations for metrics.

```bash
$ go run tools/trace_benchmark/main.go <INPUT FILES>
```

The input files must be one or more OTLP traces (ExportTraceServiceRequest) encoded as protobuf binary files.


## Integration with the OpenTelemetry Collector

Two experimental repositories have been created to develop the integration with the collector.
* [experimental-arrow-proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/experimental-arrow-proto)
* [experimental-arrow-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/experimental-arrow-collector)
